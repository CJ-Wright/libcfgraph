  "description": "Adept (Automatic Differentiation using Expression Templates) is a free C++\nsoftware library that enables algorithms to be automatically differentiated,\nvery useful for a wide range of applications that involve mathematical\noptimization. It uses an operator overloading approach, so very little code\nmodification is required. Moreover, the way that expression templates have been\nused and several other important optimizations mean that reverse-mode\ndifferentiation is significantly faster than other C++ libraries that provide\nequivalent functionality.\n\nThe fundamental object of most mathematical software is the array, and it is\ntherefore natural to want to differentiate array expressions. There are numerous\nmature C++ array libraries that support a wide variety of array operations, but\nbecause they also use expression templates to optimize array expressions, they\ndo not work efficiently with Adept. The solution provided in version 2 of\nAdept is to use a single expression-template framework that incorporates both\narray and automatic-differentiation capabilities at a low level, thus enabling\nefficient differentiation of array expressions. Arrays of up to 7 dimensions are\nsupported along with matrix multiplication and basic linear algebra operations.\nOf course, the library also works well with passive arrays (those that do not\nneed to be differentiated).\n",
