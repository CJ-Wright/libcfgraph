It uses an operator overloading approach, so very little code\nmodification is required. Moreover, the way that expression templates have been\nused and several other important optimizations mean that reverse-mode\ndifferentiation is significantly faster than other C++ libraries that provide\nequivalent functionality.\n\nThe fundamental object of most mathematical software is the array, and it is\ntherefore natural to want to differentiate array expressions.

The solution provided in version 2 of\nAdept is to use a single expression-template framework that incorporates both\narray and automatic-differentiation capabilities at a low level, thus enabling\nefficient differentiation of array expressions. Arrays of up to 7 dimensions are\nsupported along with matrix multiplication and basic linear algebra operations.\nOf course, the library also works well with passive arrays (those that do not\nneed to be differentiated).\n",
