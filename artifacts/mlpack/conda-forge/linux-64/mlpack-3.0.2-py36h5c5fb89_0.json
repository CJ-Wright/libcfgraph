  "description": "mlpack is an intuitive, fast, and flexible C++ machine learning library\nwith bindings to other languages. It is meant to be a machine learning analog\nto LAPACK, and aims to implement a wide array of machine learning methods and\nfunctions as a \"swiss army knife\" for machine learning researchers. In addition\nto its powerful C++ interface, mlpack also provides command-line programs and\nPython bindings.\n",
