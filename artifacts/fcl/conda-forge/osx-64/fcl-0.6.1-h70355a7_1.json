  "description": "FCL is a library for performing three types of proximity queries on a pair of geometric models composed of triangles.\n\n- Collision detection: detecting whether the two models overlap, and\n  optionally, all of the triangles that overlap.\n- Distance computation: computing the minimum distance between a pair of\n  models, i.e., the distance between the closest pair of points.\n- Tolerance verification: determining whether two models are closer or\n  farther than a tolerance distance.\n- Continuous collision detection: detecting whether the two moving\n  models overlap during the movement, and optionally, the time of\n  contact.\n- Contact information: for collision detection and continuous collision\n  detection, the contact information (including contact normals and\n  contact points) can be returned optionally.\n",
