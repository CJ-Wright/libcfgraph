Error handling uses a single global variable at present.\n# Note: This will be used generally to communicate with HTTP servers and specifically in the SOAP package, HTML forms and for accessing data on Web sites that require more state information than simply URL access (e.g. cookies).\n# Check: To run R CMD check, one really needs network access.
