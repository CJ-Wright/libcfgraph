You\ncan't use a centrally managed place that is responsible\nfor all the workers (like with dask or ipyparallel)\nbecause >1k cores is too many for them to handle. You\nalso don't want to use dask or ipyparallel inside a job\nscript because they write job scripts on their own.\nHaving a job script that runs code that creates job\nscripts...\nWith adaptive-scheduler you only need to define the\nlearners and then it takes care of the running\n(and restarting) of the jobs on the cluster.\n",
