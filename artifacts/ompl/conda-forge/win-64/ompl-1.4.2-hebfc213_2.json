  "description": "The Open Motion Planning Library (OMPL) consists of a set of sampling-based motion planning algorithms. The content\nof the library is limited to these algorithms, which means there is no\nenvironment specification, no collision detection or visualization. The\nlibrary is designed so it can be easily integrated into systems that provide\nthe additional needed components. For examples of complete systems using\nOMPL, see OMPL.app and MoveIt!. We have also developed a educational module\non motion planning that is centered around OMPL.app. We are looking for\neducational partners to use and further develop the material. Please contact\nus for more information.\n",
