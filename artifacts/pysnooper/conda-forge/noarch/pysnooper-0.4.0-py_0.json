You'll get a play-by-play\nlog of your function, including which lines ran and when, and exactly when local variables were changed.\n\nWhat makes PySnooper stand out from all other code intelligence tools? You can use it in your shitty,\nsprawling enterprise codebase without having to do any setup. Just slap the decorator on, as shown below,\nand redirect the output to a dedicated log file by specifying its path as the first argument.\n",
