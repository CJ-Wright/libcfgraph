Furthermore, all-pairs tests (Games-Howell test, Tamhane's T2 test,  Dunnett T3 test, Ury-Wiggins-Hochberg test) and many-to-one (Tamhane-Dunnett Test) for normally distributed residuals  and heterogeneous variances are provided.

Non-parametric trend tests (Jonckheere test, Cuzick test, Johnson-Mehrotra test, Spearman test) are included.  In addition, a Friedman-test for one-way ANOVA with repeated  measures on ranks (CRBD) and Skillings-Mack test for unbalanced  CRBD is provided with consequent all-pairs tests (Nemenyi test,  Siegel test, Miller test, Conover test, Exact test) and many-to-one tests (Nemenyi test, Demsar test, Exact test).  A trend can be tested with Pages's test. Durbin's test  for a two-way balanced incomplete block design (BIBD) is given  in this package as well as Gore's test for CRBD with multiple observations per cell is given.  Outlier tests, Mandel's k- and h statistic as well as functions for Type I error and Power  analysis as well as generic summary, print and plot methods  are provided.",
