  "description": "The greenlet package is a spin-off of Stackless, a version of CPython that\nsupports micro-threads called \"tasklets\". Tasklets run pseudo-concurrently\n(typically in a single or a few OS-level threads) and are synchronized with\ndata exchanges on \"channels\".\n\nA \"greenlet\", on the other hand, is a still more primitive notion of\nmicro-thread with no implicit scheduling; coroutines, in other words. This\nis useful when you want to control exactly when your code runs. You can\nbuild custom scheduled micro-threads on top of greenlet; however, it seems\nthat greenlets are useful on their own as a way to make advanced control\nflow structures. For example, we can recreate generators; the difference\nwith Python's own generators is that our generators can call nested\nfunctions and the nested functions can yield values too. Additionally,\nyou don't need a \"yield\" keyword. See the example in\ntests/test_generator.py.\n\nGreenlets are provided as a C extension module for the regular unmodified\ninterpreter.\n\nGreenlets are lightweight coroutines for in-process concurrent programming.\n",
