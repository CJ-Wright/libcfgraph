  "description": "ensmallen provides a simple set of abstractions for writing an objective\nfunction to optimize. It     also provides a large set of standard and\ncutting-edge optimizers that can be used for virtually any mathematical\noptimization task. These include full-batch gradient descent techniques,\nsmall-batch techniques, gradient-free optimizers, and constrained optimization.\n",
