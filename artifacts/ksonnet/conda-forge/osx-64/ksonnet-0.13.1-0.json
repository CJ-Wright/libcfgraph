With its CLI, you can generate a complete application from scratch in only a few commands, or manage a complex system at scale.\nSpecifically, ksonnet allows you to:\n* Reuse common manifest patterns (within your app or from external libraries)\n* Customize manifests directly with powerful object concatenation syntax\n* Deploy app manifests to multiple environments\n* Diff across environments to compare two running versions of your app\nTrack the entire state of your app configuration in version controllable files\nAll of this results in a more iterative process for developing manifests, one that can be supplemented by continuous integration (CI).\n",
